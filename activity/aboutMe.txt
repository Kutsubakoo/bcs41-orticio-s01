I am Angelo Miguel Orticio, 20 years old, and currently residing in Silang, Cavite. I am the youngest child and the cutest in the family. My hobbies are playing Basketball, Video Games, Cycling, and other physical activities. 

I am motivated to join this bootcamp because it has been my dream ever since I was a little kid. This bootcamp is what inspired me to strive harder and harder in life because I know that pushing my limits will push me to earn what I have now and to be enough for this bootcamp.

I have some work experience such as being a Junior Officer for Sponsorship in a school organization called SINAG Society of Leaders wherein I handled Emails of sponsors and partners of our organization. I also worked as an intern for Doodlepress Media Consulting wherein we developed a website that generates a business name based on the user's inputted keyword. I mainly worked in the backend part of the website.
