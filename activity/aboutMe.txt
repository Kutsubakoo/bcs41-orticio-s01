I am Angelo Miguel Orticio, 20 years old, and currently residing in Silang, Cavite. I am the youngest child and the cutest in the family. My hobbies are playing Basketball, Video Games, Cycling, and other physical activities. 

I am motivated to join this bootcamp because it has been my dream ever since I was a little kid. This bootcamp is what inspired me to strive harder and harder in life because I know that pushing my limits will push me to earn what I have now and to be enough for this bootcamp.
